| **Electro-Thermal Coupling in TSV-3D ICs (2024 review)** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} | Semi-3D | Surveys **electro-thermal coupling** phenomena in TSV stacks and their reliability impact. | Review of simulation methodologies | Confirms that electrical activity ↔ thermal fields ↔ reliability — i.e., the **coupled** nature HSL-3D targets. | Lacks a cross-domain **stability index** linking timing/jitter with thermo-mechanical stress. |
| **Jiao et al. (2024) – Low-Stress TSV Arrays** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} | Semi-3D | **Hollow W-TSV** structure reduces thermal stress by providing expansion “void” space. | Design + modeling + experiments | Structural change reduces stress “hotspots”, consistent with **moving toward a stability band**. | No generalizable **dimensionless metric** to compare stability across pitches/materials. |
| **TSV Tech & Multi-Physics Challenges (2024 SoA)** :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} | Semi-3D | State-of-the-art TSV: highlights **electro-thermal-mechanical field coupling** driving breakdown & failures. | Review | Strong precedent that **multi-field coupling** is central to reliability (HSI’s raison d’être). | Stops short of proposing a **scalable index** to navigate trade-offs. |
| **Chiplet 2.5D/3D I/O: clock-skew & non-linear coupling** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} | Semi-3D | Notes **nonlinear electrical–thermal–mechanical coupling** affecting 3D clock-skew reduction. | Thesis/monograph synthesis | Ties coupling directly to **timing stability** (jitter/skew) — a core HSL-3D output. | No compact invariant to keep systems in a **safe ridge** across operating points. |
| **SemiEngineering – HBM reliability context (2024)** :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} | Semi-3D | Industry view: TSV microbumps, reflow/bonding and **thermo-mechanical** stresses drive HTOL/THB/cycling tests. | Industry report | Practical driver for an HSI that unifies **design rules ↔ reliability screens**. | Lacks analytic formulation; empirical screening only. |
| **MEMS frequency stability: ppb-level via compensation (2025)** :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} | MEMS/NEMS | **Nonlinearity-mediated temperature compensation** keeps resonator frequency ultra-stable (±14 ppb). | Device + control strategy | Demonstrates **“stability bands”** where thermo-elastic drift is actively controlled — a **cross-field validation** of band-limited stability. | Device-specific; not an architecture-level index. |
| **TCf reviews / thermoelastic drift in resonators (2025, 2018)** :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} | MEMS/NEMS | Surveys **temperature-coefficient of frequency** and **thermoelastic effects** as primary drift mechanisms. | Reviews | Shows that **frequency/timing stability** is governed by thermo-elastic coupling; parallels timing-jitter in 3D ICs. | No cross-layer stack measure; component-scale metrics only. |
| **Noise-driven NEMS sensors (2024)** :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} | MEMS/NEMS | Leverages thermal/noise dynamics for robust sensing at ambient — stability via **controlled coupling**. | Experimental + theory | Reinforces the idea that **controlled coupling** produces **predictable stability windows**. | Different regime (sensing), but conceptually supportive. |
| **Power devices: ΔTj & lifetime models (2024–2025)** :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} | Power | Reliability **indices** & lifetime models use **junction temperature swing (ΔTj)** and **Tj,max** as compact predictors; damage accumulation links to **thermal cycles**. | Reviews + empirical modeling | Mature precedent for **scalar health/stability metrics** used in design & prognosis — analogous to an HSI. | Thermal-dominant; less explicit on mechanical–electrical timing links. |
| **Thermal-aware TSV arrays for heat management (2022)** :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} | Semi-3D | Optimizes **TSV placement/arrays** for thermal paths in 3D ICs. | Modeling + optimization | Supports the **P (pitch) ↔ R_th ↔ stress** triad central to HSI variables. | No explicit coupling to timing/jitter behavior. |
| **Chiplet/3D co-sim & structural-thermal aware floorplanning (2025)** :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} | Semi-3D | **STAMP-2.5D**: FEA-based co-simulation to minimize temp & stress in chiplet assemblies. | FEA + optimization | Operationalizes multi-physics design loops that an HSI could **steer**. | Still lacks a cross-case **dimensionless invariant**. |

> ✳️ Interpretation: Across domains, **compact stability proxies** (e.g., ΔTj, TCf) are widely used. 3DIC research recognizes **tight coupling** among fields, but lacks a unifying **dimensionless index** that simultaneously captures **pitch/material/phase-alignment** effects. This is where HSL-3D (HSI + bands) can contribute.
