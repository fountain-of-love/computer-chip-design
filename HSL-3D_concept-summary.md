## Concept Summary
### üß© Concept Summary ‚Äî ‚ÄúHarmonic Scaling Law for 3D Interconnect Thermoelastic Stability‚Äù (HSL-3D)

**Core Discovery: A new field-level invariant is proposed for 3D chip stacking ‚Äî the Harmonic Scaling Constant ($\mathbf{H}$):**

$$
H = \frac{P}{\alpha \cdot \phi}
$$

Where:
* $\mathbf{P}$ = interconnect **pitch** ($\mu$m)
* $\mathbf{\alpha}$ = effective **thermal expansion mismatch** between layers ($\text{ppm/K}$)
* $\mathbf{\phi}$ = **phase alignment factor** between electrical excitation and mechanical resonance (0‚Äì1)

**Hypothesis:**
When $\mathbf{H}$ stays roughly **constant** across layers, the system naturally minimizes **thermo-mechanical stress**, **warpage**, and **timing drift**. This means a single, predictive ratio might unify three domains ‚Äî **mechanical**, **thermal**, and **temporal** ‚Äî that are normally optimized separately.

**Significance:**
1.  Acts as a **continuity constant** for 3D stacking ‚Äî like "Moore‚Äôs constant" but for **stability**, not transistor count.
2.  Provides a quantitative **"continuity budget"** for DTCO and packaging teams.
3.  Reframes Imec-style finite-element simulations into a **scaling law**, not just empirical data fitting.

## Validation Framework
### üî¨ Validation Framework ‚Äî ‚ÄúHSL-3D Validation Plan‚Äù

This document operationalizes the hypothesis into an **8-phase validation program** using only public data and standard tools.

| Phase | Focus | Key Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Collect baseline public data | Generic materials, geometries, power maps |
| **1** | Build mechanical, thermal & electrical models | Stress, warpage, timing jitter |
| **2‚Äì3** | Define $\phi$ (phase coupling) & $\alpha_{eff}$ (CTE mismatch) | Quantifiable factors |
| **4** | Parameter sweeps | Evaluate $P, \alpha, \phi$ combinations |
| **5** | Derive stability index $S$ | Locate stress/jitter minima and extract $H$ |
| **6** | Sanity checks | Verify dimensional invariance and robustness |
| **7** | Hardware proxy demo | Simple two-die test with heaters + ring oscillators |
| **8** | Acceptance metrics | $R^2 \ge 0.7$ constancy of $H$; $\ge30\%$ stress+jitter reduction |

If validated, $\mathbf{H}$ becomes a measurable invariant that predicts the **"safe ridge"** of design space where thermal and electrical stability align.
