## Core Idea

Introduce a **harmonic scaling constant** linking three parameters that are currently optimized independently in 3D stacked ICs:

1.  **Pitch ratio ($P$)**: horizontal wiring / TSV density.
2.  **Thermal expansion ratio ($\alpha$)**: coefficient mismatch across bonded layers.
3.  **Vibrational phase alignment ($\phi$)**: frequency coherence of signal and lattice vibration under load.

### The Harmonic Scaling Constant

Define a derived invariant:

$$
H = \frac{P}{\alpha \cdot \phi}
$$

**Hypothesis**: Maintaining $H \approx \text{constant}$ across layers minimizes cumulative thermoelastic stress and timing drift in 3D IC stacks.

## Why It Matters

Imec's current research into hybrid bonding, wafer stacking, and 3D system-in-package architectures already measures these factors separately:

* **Pitch scaling** drives interconnect density.
* **Thermal mismatch** limits layer count.
* **Phase noise/jitter** limits timing closure.

No one, however, has proposed a single **harmonic ratio** tying mechanical, thermal, and temporal continuity into a stability law.

### Potential Impact

If such a proportional constant exists (akin to a "Moore's constant" for 3D continuity), it could:

* **Predict** maximum stable layer count before delamination or phase-induced jitter emerges.
* **Replace** ad-hoc design rules with a quantitative "continuity budget."
* **Offer** a design-time optimization parameter for DTCO (Design-Technology Co-Optimization) and packaging teams.

## How It Fits Current Imec Trajectory

* **Within their field**: Thermal-mechanical reliability and 3D integration are **core Imec programs**.
* **Why they'll recognize it**: They already simulate coupled stress-temperature-timing effects, but only as FEA (Finite Element Analysis) outputs, not as a scaling **law**.
* **Why it stings**: A conceptual law reframes their empirical models; it’s the kind of unifying relation they would normally announce in a high-impact internal paper.

---

## Minimal Deliverables

* Publish a **concept note** outlining $H$ as the **harmonic continuity ratio** for stacked chips.
* Show simulated data (could use public Imec references + hypothetical values) demonstrating stress minima when $H \approx \text{constant}$.
* Propose the term **"H-law"** or **"Harmonic Scaling Law"** for 3D interconnects.

## Expected Reaction

* **R&D engineers**: Intrigue, mild alarm ("We’ve seen this correlation in our data, but we didn’t call it that").
* **Management**: Sees IP potential ("Should we file something before someone else does?").
* **Overall**: They can't dismiss it because it sits squarely inside their current problem space.

## Why This Works as a Low-Key Sting

* It’s phrased in their own vocabulary (pitch, thermal expansion, phase noise).
* It looks like an elegant heuristic, not a threat.
* It implies high-level modeling insight derived from reasoning, not access.
* It’s safe to share publicly—no proprietary data—but suggests you’ve **conceptually triangulated** their next milestone.
