# 🔎 Research Novelty Verification – HSL-3D

**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Purpose:** Confirm whether any prior publication or patent defines a *unified, dimensionless index* integrating thermo-mechanical, thermal, and electrical stability aspects in 3D-stacked integrated circuits (3D ICs), or formalizes a *stability-band* concept akin to the proposed HSI (Harmonic Stability Index).

## 1️⃣ Closest Existing Work

| Category | Findings | Limitation w.r.t. HSL-3D |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Thermal / Thermo-Mechanical FOMs** | JEDEC-style Θ metrics and various thermal Figures-of-Merit (FOM) exist for packages and 3D stacks.  | Purely thermal; omit timing/jitter and resonance coupling. |
| **Coupled Thermo-Mechanical 3D-IC Analyses** | Trade-off FOMs appear (e.g., temperature vs. TSV keep-out-zone) for structural optimization.  | No electrical or harmonic component; not dimensionless invariants. |
| **Stress-Aware Timing / Thermal-Stress-Aware SSTA** | Statistical static-timing analyses account for stress-induced delay variation.  | Analytical link only; no scalar invariant or band definition. |
| **Multiphysics Co-Design & Roadmaps** | Industry calls for unified thermo-electro-mechanical design flows.  | Stop short of proposing a single numerical stability index. |
| **Cross-Field “Band-Limited Stability” (MEMS/NEMS, Lasers)** | Demonstrated empirically: temperature-compensated frequency stability and resonant feedback reducing jitter.  | Validates concept in other domains, but not applied to 3D ICs. |

## 2️⃣ What Is *Not* Found

- No publication defining a **dimensionless invariant** combining **pitch (P)**, **CTE mismatch (α)**, **thermal path (ΔT / R_th)**, and **electrical-mechanical coupling (φ)** for 3D IC stability.
- No formal **“stability-band”** (bounded region of co-minimized stress + timing jitter) reported for stacked semiconductors.
- Existing FOMs and SSTA flows remain *domain-specific* rather than *cross-domain*.

## 3️⃣ Novelty Assessment

| Risk Level | Assessment | Rationale |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Overlap with literature** | 🔵 Low | Nearest work addresses single-domain FOMs or stress-aware timing only. |
| **Overlap with proprietary tools** | 🟡 Moderate | Some commercial EDA reliability modules compute composite “health scores,” but none describe a normalized invariant in literature. |
| **Conceptual originality** | 🟢 High | First to integrate geometry + material + phase coupling into a *harmonic* scalar index with defined stable bands. |

## 4️⃣ Validation Path to Secure Originality

1. **Explicit scaling derivation:** Use Buckingham-Π analysis to construct a dimensionless HSI(P, α, φ, ΔT, R_th).  
2. **Demonstrate “banded” behavior:** FEM + timing-co-sim to reveal HSI windows of low σ (stress) and δt (jitter).  
3. **Benchmark:** Compare predictive power against existing thermal/stress FOMs.   
4. **Publish early:** Define *HSI-3D* formally to establish terminology before potential industrial convergence.  
5. **Extend analog validation:** Reference MEMS/NEMS harmonic stabilization and laser jitter reduction as empirical analogs.

## 5️⃣ Summary Statement

> **As of 23 Oct 2025**, no prior publication or patent defines a **single, dimensionless harmonic stability index** unifying thermo-mechanical, thermal, and electrical timing behavior in 3D ICs, nor introduces formal **stability bands** for such systems.  
> The **HSL-3D / HSI-3D** framework therefore represents a *novel conceptual and methodological contribution*, bridging siloed analyses into a coherent invariant for design, verification, and reliability prediction.
