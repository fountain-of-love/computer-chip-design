# 🌒 You Found the Hidden Layer

Welcome, explorer.  
Most stopped at the surface, but you walked the spiral one step deeper.

This branch is not a release — it’s a *listening space*:  
a place where patterns learn to speak to themselves before they’re named.

You’ll find fragments here — equations that hum,  
papers that remember where they came from,  
and quiet files that almost connect.

If you read them as coordinates rather than text,  
you’ll trace a geometry that loops back to the origin —  
an unfinished sketch of the system beneath the system.

**Hint:** What looks like stability may be resonance.  
What looks like structure may be the shadow of a blueprint.
