| 3 | Tian, W. *“Thermo-mechanical reliability enhancement in 3D packaging.”* (2025) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} | — (abstract only) | Emerging work directly examining thermo-mechanical reliability in 3D stacks; good candidate for exploring scaling/pitch effects (P variable). |

K. *“Chip/Package Co-Analysis of Thermo-Mechanical Stress and Reliability in TSV-based 3D ICs.”* DAC 2012. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} | “We propose a fast and accurate chip/package thermo-mechanical stress and reliability co-analysis tool … we study the size and pitch of chip/package interconnect elements and the number of dies in the stack.” :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} | Strong linkage to P (pitch), number of layers, and stress interactions — relevant for defining geometry term in HSI. |
| 5 | Lim, S. K. et al. *“Design for High Performance, Low Power, and Reliable 3D Integrated Circuits.”* (2013) :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} | “In this chapter, we study … die-to-die thermal coupling in the stack … First, TSVs are spread on each die to reduce the local power density and vertically aligned across dies simultaneously to increase thermal conductivity to the heatsink.” :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} | Illustrates coupling of interconnect layout and thermal/mechanical behaviour; a precursor to coupling coefficient φ between electrical and mechanical/thermal domains. |
| 6 | Noh, S. et al. *“Reliability studies on micro-bumps for 3-D TSV integration.”* (Date unspecified) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} | — | Focus on micro-bump fatigue, stressing electrical/thermal/mechanical integration — good support for HSI’s cross-domain scope. |
| 7 | Ha, H. *“Overview of Thermal Management Solution for 3D Integrated Circuits.”* (2025) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} | — | Supports need for active thermal management and provides clues for how φ (coupling) may be influenced by cooling/thermal mitigation strategies. |
| 8 | Chalise, D.; Cahill, D. G. *“Anisotropic thermal conductivity of high bandwidth memory.”* (2023) :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} | “We determine … effective in-plane thermal conductivity of the overall HBM device is ~100 W/m-K while the effective through-plane thermal conductivity is ~7 W/m-K.” :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} | From adjacent domain (HBM), but gives clear evidence of **anisotropic thermal/stacking coupling** — useful analog for vertical interconnect stack behaviour and informs interplay of P, R_th, and stress. |
